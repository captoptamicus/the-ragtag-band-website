               <br>
               <h2> Medicare For All</h2>
               <p class="text-center"><a class="text-white" href="">Nearly every other developed country on the planet has some version of a universal healthcare system. This means people can go in to see a doctor without fear of being billed thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars. Medicare For All would set the required age to zero so that everyone would be covered. This includes dental, vision, mental health, the disabled, women’s hygiene, and much more. It also eliminates deductibles, copays, and pharmaceutical price gouging. Every human being has inherent worth and you deserve to live without fearing the worst if you’re unemployed. No longer shall we tether our health to employment. We need Medicare For All and The Ragtag Band supports any and all endeavors at the municipal, state, and federal level to see it to fruition.</a></p>
                <br>
                <h2> Green New Deal</h2>
                <p class="text-center"><a href="" class="text-white">Climate change is not coming. Climate change is here. We are seeing devastating natural disasters from coast to coast let alone the rest of the world. The Eastern coastline as well as the Gulf have been wailed by hurricane after hurricane, three superstorms hitting in 2021 alone at the time of this posting. On the West and even now in the Midwest we are seeing wildfires ravaging miles upon miles of greenery. The Green New Deal is not just an environmental program, it is a jobs program. It has the bold plan to completely revamp and rejuvenate America’s entire power system. High speed cross country rail-lines, building renewable, sustainable energy sources such as solar panels and windmill farms, job training to help those in the fossil fuel industry more easily adapt, and so on. AOC and Ed Markey have introduced the Green New Deal to Congress and, while we by no means believe the bill is absolutely perfect, it is a major step in combating the climate apocalypse we will see if we don’t change our ways. There are “green initiatives” at the state and local levels as well that we ardently support.</a></p>
               <br>
               <h2> Federal Jobs Guarantee</h2>
               <p class="text-center"><a href="" class="text-white">The Federal Jobs Guarantee is an immaculate idea and should be one of the easiest “Yes’s” we’ve ever had in terms of platform policy. Stemming from the Modern Monetary Theory lens, the FJG is the solution to combating inflation and unemployment. Should the private sector hit an economic bump in the road such as another Recession or Depression, the FJG will be there to pick up the slack. And when the curve turns upwards the private sector can hire out of the public option pool. What the Federal Jobs Guarantee effectively does are three things: 1) it eliminates the idea of the “natural rate of unemployment” meaning everyone who is involuntarily unemployed can have a job, 2) if a bump in the road occurs, it provides the economy with a cushion by giving people who have been laid off jobs, which then stimulates the economy more so than if they were laid off and scrambling to find work or receive unemployment. Thus, it provides a smoother transition, 3) To continuously provide jobs, enormous projects would be listed and undertaken, namely infrastructure, which has been sorely needed for at least a decade. The Federal Jobs Guarantee is an aggressive intersecting linchpin that will potentially provide the answers to many problems and The Ragtag Band is adamantly in support of this policy.</a></p>
               <br>
               <h3> Free Public College, Trade School, & Student Debt Cancellation </h3>
               <p class="text-center"><a href="" class="text-white">America has more than enough capability to make higher education free as well as eliminate all student debt. As self-proclaimed pirates, we believe there are a variety of situations in which anchors are helpful and necessary. However, the weight of the student loan “crisis” is like an anchor around two generation’s necks and is only being used to drown them. It has been statistically proven the better educated you are the higher your income will be, but it does not matter if you cannot make enough at the baseline to get ahead. Wage has not budged in decades whereas everything else has increased in cost including housing, healthcare, and many other pivotal necessities that make it possible to be independent let alone live a comfortable life.
                It also bars those in lower socioeconomic statuses from even being able to attend school thus widening the wealth disparity. When high schoolers have to decide whether to work or go to school they understand the choice is extremely difficult. Many work two or three jobs just to keep their head above water let alone thinking about school. And programs that want you full time and demand that you don’t work are outright prohibitive to certain people. 
                This will not stand. We must cut the anchor, give our younger generations the opportunity the older ones benefitted from as well as making sure anyone can go to school and reach their true potential.
                </a></p>
                <br>
                <h3> End the Wars & the Military Industrial Complex</h3>
                <p class="text-center">
                <a href="" class="text-white">This one should be an absolute no-brainer. We can always find the money for war and that is because Congress will always have the votes to wage it. War is one of the cornerstones of our economy. Overt time, America has become more and more lazy at trying to hide the fact that it is simply three war-profiteering, oil-thieving corporations in a trenchcoat. We must end the warmongering. We must end the needless death on both sides. How many souls could we have saved in the last twenty years had we never invaded Iraq and Afghanistan? How much money did we spend? We must put an end to corporations like Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. We must prohibit military recruiters from entering high schools, especially those in more impoverished areas. It is outright wrong what America has done to the rest of the world. And what they don’t want to tell you--what they don’t want you to know--is that a peacemaking economy is possible. This is what we must strive for. This is what we must move towards.</a>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3> Housing For All</h3>
                <p class="text-center"><a href="" class="text-white">It is stated that there are approximately 633,000 homeless people in America and nearly 13.9 million unoccupied homes.That is unacceptable. Everyone deserves a roof over their head. We spend millions if not billions as a country creating anti-homeless architecture such as armrests on benches and cone-shaped spikes under bridges so they’re unable to sleep, we have police ticket them and construction workers tearing up their tents, destroying what few possessions they have. Enough is enough. We have the resources to house our homeless and it is absolutely despicable that we basically torture them instead. The Ragtag Band stands by Guaranteed Housing for All and will always fight for everyone to have a safe place to rest their weary eyes.</a></p>
                <br>
                <h3> Legalize Marijuana, Expunge Records, & Administer Reparations</h3>
                <p class="text-center"><a href="" class="text-white">It is objective truth that is universally known at this point that marijuana prohibition always stemmed from completely racist and unequivocally false allegations. Initially, it was stated that marijuana made Mexicans thirst for white blood. Then it was used as the cornerstone for the War on Drugs to infiltrate meetings run by groups such as the Black Panthers and arrest their leaders. Federal marijuana legalization must be passed, but we refuse to stop there. We want to see criminal records for drug possession and usage expunged, we want to see those people released from prison, and we want to see whoever passes it, whether it be at the state or federal level, help build dispensaries, license those interested, and pay reparations to the families and communities affected by the War on Drugs.
	            The Ragtag Band stands with these communities and will do everything in our power to use our voice and our platform as a bullhorn to make sure this is heard.
                </a></p>
                <br>
                <h3> Money Out of Politics/No Corp PAC Money</h3>
                <p class="text-center"><a href="" class="text-white">We must have campaign finance reform. We must see money out of politics. If you get money out of politics, you make the job a lot less appealing. No one wants to be a career politician if they can’t make millions of dollars off of it. We have to believe campaign finance reform will deter the greedy from running. We believe corporations are writing legislation and paying our representatives to vote for it. We believe the people no longer have a seat at the table because of how easily votes can be bought. People are so easily corrupted and money is culprit. 
	            We also believe Term Limits would enhance the effect of deterring people as well. Your day job is always supposed to be there when you’re done serving your country. We would hope this new format would attract more upstanding citizens who want to do right by their communities, do what they can to help move us forward, and go back to their lives when they’ve done their civic duty. No one should be in any level of government for 40+ years. Money over time makes us jaded and they must never forget who they’re working for.
	            We must also abolish Citizens United, which deemed corporations to be seen as individuals and thus created a loophole where they don’t pay anything in federal income tax. Amazon? A billions upon billions of dollar industry pays nothing in federal income tax. That’s not right. To now take it a step further and catch up on all the money lost due to absurd mishap, check out our Wealth Tax blurb.

                <br>
                <h3> Alternative Voting Systems & Abolishing the Electoral College</h3>
                <p class="text-center"><a href="" class="text-white">The Ragtag Band is 100% on board with nearly any other voting system than the one currently in place. While they were by no means the best of people, even the Framers of the Constitution believed a two-party system would lead to disaster. What we have now, known as First-Past-The-Post (FPTP), Single Choice Voting, Plurality Voting--whatever you’d like to call it--is a complete abomination and an absolute stain on all democracy.
                We believe First Past The Post should be replaced at all levels of government. Our most favorable option is STAR Voting, but we understand Ranked Choice Voting may carry the most momentum in many states. We are also friendly with Score and Approval voting as well. The fact of the matter is all of these alternative voting systems are leagues better than what is in place now.
                We all have standards and we all have morals. The term “third party” should not exist in a democracy. Every candidate should have a fair chance at a seat. This is also where money comes into play. When you have the backing of a major party, the party gives you funding and resources whereas a minor party or independent candidate may not be able to compete. We cannot continue to be fear-mongered into voting for “the lesser of two evils,” especially when there is no “lesser” option anymore. Don’t allow them to use your virtues against you. Don’t allow them to scare you with “vote splitting.” Screw them for not putting up a decent enough candidate. You don’t need them. They need you. Make them earn your vote!
                The Electoral College is prehistoric by global standards and must go. We have the ability to make sure that if one candidate gets 49% of the vote in a state and another gets 48% and 3% goes to whoever else that these votes are split up proportionately.
                    </a></p>

                <h3> Immigration</h3>
                <p class="text-center"><a href="" class="text-white">The stigma we’ve developed around immigrants is both heinous and heartbreaking. Our history with immigration is tarnished with dark spots for absolutely no good reason. We believe, first and foremost, that ICE must be abolished and the children released from the cages they’re being kept in and reunited with their parents. We believe societal mindset must change. Immigrants aren’t stealing your jobs. They’re buying into free market capitalism by undercutting people so they can afford to eat and help their families. And they’re being taken advantage of in many instances by doing this. America also used to have a “revolving door” policy where those from South America, especially Mexico, could come in, make their money, and go home. When America shut down this “revolving door” it trapped all those people inside. The reason the Model Minority Myth exists in regard to Asians is also because of heinous immigration standards which only allowed Asians that Americans deemed “smart” or “successful” enough to enter. We must reform immigration law, make it easier to gain citizenship, and tear down the societal stigmas that have been built so high.</a></p>
                 <br>
                 <h3> Disability Rights</h3>
                 <p class="text-center"><a href="" class="text-white">Judy Huemann is a giant among people in the disabled community. Her organizational and leadership skills led to some of the most the progressive legislation, namely the ADA, for the disabled community. But we will not stop fighting for those that need it most. We will not stop caring for society’s perceived weakest citizens.</a></p>
                  <br>
                  <h3> Women’s Rights</h3>
                  <p class="text-center"><a href="" class="text-white">It is an absolute disgrace that viagra is covered by health insurance, but women’s hygiene is not. It is an absolute disgrace that white women are still making $0.82 compared to their male counterparts and that it’s even less for women of color. It is an absolute disgrace if not an outright failure of society that we now have a court that will turn a blind eye to a pro-choice lifestyle. These things must be written into law. Roe vs. Wade must be codified. Women deserve more.</a></p>
                  <br>
                  <h3> LGBTQIA+ Rights</h3>
                  <p class="text-center"><a href="" class="text-white">It is unequivocally NOT ENOUGH that same-sex marriage was legalized in 2015. We must make sure the LGBTQIA+ community are federally allowed to marry, allowed to adopt, are not discriminated against, and are protected from hate crimes. We must make sure conversion therapy and panic defense are outlawed. We believe the transgender community has every right to be covered by Medicare For All.</a></p>
                  <br>
                  <h3> Indigenous Rights</h3>
                  <p class="text-center"><a href="" class="text-white">The indigenous peoples’ resilience and adaptation in America is unprecedented. No one likes to talk about the fact that many nations stole America’s playbook when committing outright genocide. And we believe we should pay reparations to the indigenous as well. While many have found footholds in the US’s capitalistic lifestyle, there are many, many more struggling. They do not have clean water, they have been cornered off onto reservations, and these reservations have corporations trying to build oil pipelines through the middle of them without giving the people a second thought. They deserve more. They deserve MUCH more. We annexed Hawaii and denied them statehood for fifty years. When the natives came together to file for statehood, asking for a large chunk of what we know as Oklahoma, for a state called Sequoyah in 1905 they were denied. We have ravaged sacred ground. We have even given federal recognition to tribes only to strip it away. It is time to stand with the Indigenous peoples and help them in their fight to protect what is left of what was always rightfully theirs.</a></p>
              <br>
              <h3> Infrastructure</h3>
              <p class="text-center"><a href="" class="text-white">Infrastructure greatly intersects with many other platform points as well, but none more so than the Green New Deal. Not only is our infrastructure crumbling and outdated, but the amount of energy many things take such as our railroads are inefficient. We are looking to completely reimagine society. High speed railways, solar and wind farms, robust legislation to push for more electric vehicles on the road, universal broadband, TELEPHONE POLES AND WIRING UNDERGROUND!!! We are looking at massive infrastructure projects just waiting to be had all with the help of the Green New Deal and the Federal Jobs Guarantee</a></p>
              <br>
              <h3> Wealth Tax</h3>
              <p class="text-center"><a href="" class="text-white">A good portion of the crew that makes up The Ragtag Band is either in support of or getting on board with Modern Monetary Theory. However, just because a government deficit means the private sector is in the black, it does not mean everyone in the private sector is in the black and this is a gargantuan issue as the wealth disparity expands into an ever larger chasm. On top of believing in MMT, we believe in a Wealth Tax. We think the affluent in this country have gone too long without paying their fair share and we are done with that. Whether on the federal level in Bernie’s platform or scaled to size for a state level initiative, we ardently encourage policy to tax the ass off the uber-wealthy.</a></p>
               <br>
               <h3> Living Wage, Labor, Unions, & Worker’s Rights</h3>
               <p class="text-center"><a href="" class="text-white">It has been statistically proven everything has risen in cost over the last two decades while wages have remained stagnant. That’s absolutely incorrigible. People are working two or three jobs just to keep their heads above water. We absolutely will NOT stand for that. At the time of this writing in 2021, The Ragtag Band is demanding no less than a $25 federal minimum wage. It is disgusting and disgraceful what oligarchs and legislators have done to the working and middle class. $15 is the bare minimum, floor level, piddlywink garbage they’re trying to pawn off on you, but that is simply not enough. Everyone deserves a living wage without having to work multiple jobs. You deserve a steady source of income from one job. We work to live, NOT live to work. They want every second of your time to bleed you dry. The Ragtag Band supports unionization, we support worker’s rights, and we’ll support you if you strike. We also believe in decriminalizing sex work</a></p>
